                    <h4>Why should I come?</h4>
                    <p>So many reasons! We're building a community of ambitious, like-minded students who have the chance to connect with social entrepreneurs, mentors, career opportunities, and capital. We want you to leave the conference feeling like you took one giant step closer to your future at the intersection of tech and social good. Maybe that's because you won some prize money for a venture you've already been working on. Or maybe it's because you found your next internship. Or maybe it's because you made a best friend for the summer. Whatever it is, we want to be a part of making that possible!
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                    <h4>What can I reasonably expect?</h4>
                    <p>Lots of learning, lots of laughter, really kind people! Definitely a few late night conversations on life, the universe, and everything. And stickers. We'll have quite a few of those.
                    </p>
