                            We work with any group that is, in good faith, trying to make the world a better place. We include job postings from non-profits, social enterprises, and for-profit companies with social-impact positions. Other opportunity postings can come from a wide range of places, such as student clubs hosting hackathons or civic fellowship positions.
