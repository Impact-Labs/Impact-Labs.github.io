				<h4>Why should I participate?</h4>
				<p>
					So many reasons! We're building a community of ambitious, like-minded students who have the chance to connect with social entrepreneurs, mentors, career opportunities, and capital. We want you to leave the conference feeling like you took one giant step closer to your future at the intersection of tech and social good. Maybe that's because you won some prize money for a venture you've already been working on. Or maybe it's because you found your next internship. Or maybe it's because you made a best friend for the summer. Whatever it is, we want to be a part of making that possible!
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4>What can I expect?</h4>
				<p>
					Lots of learning, lots of laughter, and lots of kind people; really interesting conversations on life, the universe, and everything; a dope virtual career fair with some awesome high-impact companies; great talks from super cool people (including your peers)!
