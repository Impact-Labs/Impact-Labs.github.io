					"name": "Adi Melamed",
					"body": "For about as long as I can remember (jk, just for the past few years) I've spent my time trying to figure out how to lead a meaningful life and create a more meaningful world. That has got me interested in Earl Grey tea, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and building communities that inspire and empower others to lead more intentional and impactful lives. I am ALWAYS down to meet new people and talk about political institutions, college career decisions, and the interesting, beautiful quirks that make up the human condition. I'm always thinking about the future of human society."
				},
				{
					"name": "Aaron Mayer",
					"body": "There are three things I love in this world: technology, normative ethics, and working with my amazing Impact teammates! Talk to me about philosophy, swing dancing, the best ice cream places in NYC, effective altruism, blockchain, Super Smash Bros (Melee), educational YouTube creators, odd music preferences, or tea parties! I started Impact Labs with Adi so that we could build a world together in which we all use our talents for the good of humanity!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Ellie Czepiel",
					"body": "I believe that every person reading this bio has the power to affect positive change in the world, and I want to help them figure out how! I first got involved with Impact Labs as a 2018 Fellow, and loved the people so much that I just had to stick around! When I’m not working on Impact, I’m usually striking up conversations with new people, scheming about new social impact side projects, going on runs, and trying to convince my friends to play obscure board games (Hanabi, anyone?)."
				},
				{
					"name": "Nikhil Gupta",
					"body": "The only thing I love more than tech are humans - we are a fascinating bunch, aren't we? Let's chat about intersections of philosophy, psychology, computer science, physics, and math!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Derrek Chow",
					"body": "I became interested in CS by making websites as a kid. I’ve dived deeper into tech since then but still find myself returning to what first inspired my passion and pursuing that opportunity here at Impact Labs. Beyond CS, I have a fascination with people and their perspectives. I like talking to people about their unique take on life and their interpretations of happiness and success. For work, I crave collaboration and creativity which is why I love working with the talented and inspiring individuals at Impact Labs. I also enjoy talking about where and what to eat, design, random music knowledge, and the beautiful city of Toronto."
				},
				{
					"name": "Grace Young",
					"body": "Hello Hello, I'm a curious human who enjoys dabbling in a little of everything and discussing topics in education and design. Currently, I am learning about UI/UX, web design, topics in physics, and how to cook. I was introduced to Impact Labs by my friend Mimi, who hyped it up by saying its a really fantastic group of people to work with. I was skeptical and jumped at the opportunity and ever since has been thinking about how to bring meaningful Impact to what we do and especially to what I do as well."
				},
				{
					"name": "Minji Koo",
					"body": "By instinct, I tend to claw my way towards a destination without ever considering why I’m doing so in the first place. Maybe it’s because I’m from the frenetic hub of the Silicon Valley where everyone is chasing some vague idea of success— maybe its because I naturally have a need to work rather than face the conflicting facts and opinions and outside stimuli intruding my mind. As a designer, I actively work to counteract this tendency to mindlessly chug in a direction, and do my best to make choices with confidence and intention. I choose to run half marathons because I enjoy the physical and mental struggle. I choose to design and create visual systems because it allows me to think critically and appreciate my strengths as an individual. Most importantly, however, I choose to work with the Impact Labs team because I am surrounded by people who are as driven and enthusiastic as I strive to be everyday."
				},
				{
					"name": "Emma Amaral",
					"body": "What is a psychology and global affairs student doing in the world of computer science and technology? I used to be intimated to wade into the debate of emerging technology, but I realized that with everything from criminal justice to the future of work and the free press under unprecedented transformation, I can't afford to stay out of it. I believe that every citizen deserves a say in how we leverage technology for the greater good, and I hope to spur on those conversations alongside other youth at Impact Labs. When I do succeed in ungluing my eyes from various screens, you can find me exploring T.O.'s parks and coffee shops."
				},
				{
					"name": "Ivanna Pena",
					"body": "When I tell people I’m majoring in Computer Science and Social & Cultural Analysis, their reaction is usually “how do those fit together?” or “how did you come up with that?”. I think people have grown so accustomed to tech being attached to something negative, that they’ve overshadowed its ability to facilitate social change and propagate social good.I joined Impact Labs because of the enthusiasm everyone exhibits to using tech for good, along with their dedication to helping others do the same. Aside from Impact Labs, I love learning obscure parts of songs on the piano, solving my miniature Rubiks Cube, and roaming through the stacks at The Strand."
				},
				{
					"name": "Zhixing Che",
					"body": "Inspired by E. B. White’s famed quote, I think of my life as two complementary parts: a desire to improve (or save) the world, and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. I enjoy reading about networks, behavioral econ, and using technology to aid nonprofits on issues such as water access. Concurrently, I’m constantly enamored by the beauties of the world, and I devote time to painting, solo traveling, and reading. I’m excited by Impact Labs and its vision to bridge disparate disciplines and issues. I thrive in these intersections of nonprofit, tech, and art because they help me find ways to both save and savor."
				},
				{
					"name": "James Wang",
					"body": "For a long time, my biggest fear was losing my motivation and my passion. For some people, it's the love of a job that keeps them going or the curiosity towards a subject that drives them further. Though some people never find their thing, Impact Labs helped me find mine. Now, I want to spread this opportunity with everyone possible. PLEASE bother me if you have any questions! On the flip side, I love photography, saying I'm learning guitar, and trying to convince myself to eat healthier and exercise more. HMU if you want to get on a workout schedule or something together. Lord knows I need the help."
				},
				{
					"name": "Maeve Farrell",
					"body": "I want to contribute to making the world a fairer, more equal place, and I believe technology is the way I can do that best! Other things I love include listening to podcasts, jammin’ out on the violin, burritos, and playing board games. Lots and lots of board games."
				},
				{
					"name": "Jett Wang",
					"body": "I am a software engineer turned front-end developer turned UX & product designer. I want to drive influence with technology at the frontiers. Dedicating my work to social impact frees me from feeling stuck in zero-sum games; I hope to share these feelings and grow together as part of Impact Labs. With your verbal consent, I will give unsolicited lectures on peer-mentorship, game theory, online dating and the attention economy. But more importantly, I want to hear your story!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Christina Barta",
					"body": "Technology is powerful stuff - it shapes the world as we know it and the direction of humanity's future. I am determined to figure out how it can be used to build a world that is more creative, responsible, and just. We have so many challenges to figure out along the way - legal, ethical, scientific, and structural - and I'm proud to be working on them with the curious minds at Impact Labs! Outside of Impact, you can find me sharing meals with friends (hopefully meals that require chopsticks), showing people around art museums, losing track of time in thoughtful debate, visiting cities, or reading about tech policy, moral philosophy, feminism, the latest in machine learning, and the future of our world!"
				},
				{
					"name": "Amber Teng",
					"body": "I’m a writer, learner, and explorer. I graduated with a dual-degree in Economics and Archaeology from Brown University, and have since then pursued the intersection of my passions to a Master’s in Data Science at NYU. After attending a hackathon on a whim, I discovered the impact that data science and technology could have on emerging countries, as well as the opportunity that the field provides for data-driven storytelling. I’m an editor at Towards Data Science and a fellow at SharpestMinds. I live in New York and I was raised in Manila, and I spend most of my time thinking about how interdisciplinary collaboration can galvanize innovations in technology."
