				"name": "Adi Melamed",
				"body": "For about as long as I can remember (jk, just for the past few years) I've spent my time trying to figure out how to lead a meaningful life and create a more meaningful world. That has got me interested in Earl Grey tea, the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and building communities that inspire and empower others to lead more intentional and impactful lives. I am ALWAYS down to meet new people and talk about political institutions, college career decisions, and the interesting, beautiful quirks that make up the human condition. I'm always thinking about the future of human society."
			},
			{
				"name": "Aaron Mayer",
				"body": "There are three things I love in this world: technology, normative ethics, and working with my amazing Impact teammates! Talk to me about philosophy, swing dancing, the best ice cream places in NYC, effective altruism, blockchain, Super Smash Bros (Melee), educational YouTube creators, odd music preferences, or tea parties! I started Impact Labs with Adi so that we could build a world together in which we all use our talents for the good of humanity!"
			},
			{
				"name": "Ellie Czepiel",
				"body": "I believe that every person reading this bio has the power to affect positive change in the world, and I want to help them figure out how! I first got involved with Impact Labs as a 2018 Fellow, and loved the people so much that I just had to stick around! When I’m not working on Impact, I’m usually striking up conversations with new people, scheming about new social impact side projects, going on runs, and trying to convince my friends to play obscure board games (Hanabi, anyone?)."
			},
			{
				"name": "Georgia Gallant",
				"body": "Pushing myself outside of my comfort zone is what adds spice to my life! Some of the wacky shenanigans I have done include posing as a reporter to get the inside scoop on a political candidate, and spending two months learning survival skills with veterans in rural Maine. The only two things that I love more than forcing myself to be incredibly uncomfortable are coding and helping other people. Until meeting the Impact Labs team I didn’t know that there were companies that successfully combine social impact and computer science. Learning that those companies exist blew my mind! I love that I now have the opportunity to create the same experience for other kids!"
			},
			{
				"name": "Nikhil Gupta",
				"body": "The only thing I love more than tech are humans - we are a fascinating bunch, aren't we? Let's chat about intersections of philosophy, psychology, computer science, physics, and math!"
			},

			{
				"name": "Grace Young",
				"body": "Hello Hello, I'm a curious human who enjoys dabbling in a little of everything and discussing topics in education and design. Currently, I am learning about UI/UX, web design, topics in physics, and how to cook. I was introduced to Impact Labs by my friend Mimi, who hyped it up by saying its a really fantastic group of people to work with. I was skeptical and jumped at the opportunity and ever since has been thinking about how to bring meaningful Impact to what we do and especially to what I do as well."
			},
			{
				"name": "Minji Koo",
				"body": "By instinct, I tend to claw my way towards a destination without ever considering why I’m doing so in the first place. Maybe it’s because I’m from the frenetic hub of the Silicon Valley where everyone is chasing some vague idea of success— maybe its because I naturally have a need to work rather than face the conflicting facts and opinions and outside stimuli intruding my mind. As a designer, I actively work to counteract this tendency to mindlessly chug in a direction, and do my best to make choices with confidence and intention. I choose to run half marathons because I enjoy the physical and mental struggle. I choose to design and create visual systems because it allows me to think critically and appreciate my strengths as an individual. Most importantly, however, I choose to work with the Impact Labs team because I am surrounded by people who are as driven and enthusiastic as I strive to be everyday."
			},
			{
				"name": "Tomer Eldor",
				"body": "I believe that happiness is a choice. After dedicating most of my life to being a jazz musician, I discovered technology at the IDF intelligence, and the joy of traveling and mindfulness in a year in rural Asia. I loved it so much that I chose to study CS and Economics in 7 different countries, so that I could leverage my tech skills to help people be able to choose happiness. When I’m not in my computer, you can find me jamming at your nearest piano bar, at the gym / yoga studio, or geeking over Jacob Collier’s new release."
			},
			{
				"name": "Emma Amaral",
				"body": "What is a psychology and global affairs student doing in the world of computer science and technology? I used to be intimated to wade into the debate of emerging technology, but I realized that with everything from criminal justice to the future of work and the free press under unprecedented transformation, I can't afford to stay out of it. I believe that every citizen deserves a say in how we leverage technology for the greater good, and I hope to spur on those conversations alongside other youth at Impact Labs. When I do succeed in ungluing my eyes from various screens, you can find me exploring T.O.'s parks and coffee shops."
			},
			{
				"name": "Chris Gu",
				"body": "Mitochondria is the powerhou...wait, wrong bio. Err...I'm probably the most extroverted introvert you'll ever meet. And nowadays, you can find me studying computer science with an emphasis in bioinformatics, running my a cappella group, organizing my hackathon, and coming up with ideas for my future successful startup!"
			},
			{
				"name": "Ella Bei",
				"body": "I think technology has the potential to bring about positive social change, but like any tool, is inherently neutral. In an ideal world where all tech is purposed for good, civic technology as a separate endeavour wouldn’t need to exist - I’m dedicated to bringing us one step closer to that vision. I joined Impact Labs because I believe there are many technologists out there who are interested in social impact, yet there’s a lack of transparency regarding the types of civic technology organizations that are out there. As a CS and Urban Studies major at UPenn, I’m passionate about combating spatial disempowerment within our cities through open-source urban planning. In my free time, I like to dye my own hair, cook yummy vegetarian dishes, and play music."
			},
			{
				"name": "Lena Cohen",
				"body": "We are at a critical moment in deciding how technology will shape our society’s future. Although I oscillate between techno-phobia and techno-optimism, I joined Impact Labs because I believe that technologists can and should use their skills to build a better world. My fascination with the intersection of ethics and computer science has led me to study tech policy, data ethics, and value sensitive design. Outside of Impact, I love trail running, ultimate frisbee, crossword puzzles, weird food combinations, and snow"
			},
			{
				"name": "Ivanna Pena",
				"body": "When I tell people I’m majoring in Computer Science and Social & Cultural Analysis, their reaction is usually “how do those fit together?” or “how did you come up with that?”. I think people have grown so accustomed to tech being attached to something negative, that they’ve overshadowed its ability to facilitate social change and propagate social good.I joined Impact Labs because of the enthusiasm everyone exhibits to using tech for good, along with their dedication to helping others do the same. Aside from Impact Labs, I love learning obscure parts of songs on the piano, solving my miniature Rubiks Cube, and roaming through the stacks at The Strand."
